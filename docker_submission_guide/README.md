## Introduction

The [PhaKIR Challenge](https://phakir.re-mic.de/) aims to advance the field of surgical video analysis by tackling tasks such as phase recognition, keypoint estimation, and instrument segmentation in minimally invasive surgeries. Participants are required to submit robust models capable of analyzing real-world surgical video data under varying conditions. Submissions are managed via Docker images, which must adhere to specific guidelines for proper evaluation.

## Submission Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**  
   Download the [PhaKIR Submission Template](https://github.com/schnadoslin/PhaKIR_Submission_Template?tab=readme-ov-file#testing-and-constraints) from GitHub. Follow the instructions in the README to test your model and ensure it generates the expected results in the output directory.

2. **Submission Preparation**  
   Visit the [PhaKIR Submission Portal](https://phakir-submission.re-mic.de/) and log in **via Authentik** using your credentials.

3. **Generating an Access Token**  
   Navigate to [your settings](https://phakir-submission.re-mic.de/user/settings/applications) and generate an access token (under Settings -> Applications) with `package:read&write` permissions. This token will be required for Docker login.

4. **Docker Login**

   | :zap:        Note: For the following commands, only use lowercase letters, including for your username or teamname.
   |-----------------------------------------|

   Open your command line and log in to the PhaKIR Docker registry using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker login phakir-submission.re-mic.de -u YOUR_PHAKIR_USERNAME
   ```

   | :zap:        Note: Paste the generated token when prompted for a password.
   |-----------------------------------------|

6. **Building and Tagging a Docker Image**  
    - Proper tagging of the image is crucial:
      - Use specific tags such as `phase_recognition`, `keypoint_estimation`, or `instrument_segmentation` based on your task.
   - Build your Docker image with the command:  
     ```bash
     docker build -t phakir-submission.re-mic.de/{YOUR_PHAKIR_USERNAME}/{YOUR_PHAKIR_USERNAME_OR_TEAMNAME}:{task_tag} .
     ```
   - To re-tag an existing image, use:  
     ```bash
     docker tag {local_image}:{your_tag} phakir-submission.re-mic.de/{YOUR_PHAKIR_USERNAME}/{YOUR_PHAKIR_USERNAME_OR_TEAMNAME}:{task_tag}
     ```

7. **Uploading the Image**  
   Push the Docker image to the PhaKIR registry using:  
   ```bash
   docker push phakir-submission.re-mic.de/{YOUR_PHAKIR_USERNAME}/{YOUR_PHAKIR_USERNAME_OR_TEAMNAME}:{task_tag}
   ```
6. **Doublecheck**  
   Visit https://phakir-submission.re-mic.de/{YOUR_PHAKIR_USERNAME}/-/packages and check if the container is there.

Follow these steps carefully to ensure your solution is correctly submitted for the PhaKIR Challenge.
